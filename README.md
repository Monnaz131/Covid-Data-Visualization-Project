# SQL PortfolioProjects

This project tests my capability using SQL, by using aggregate functions, creating CTE's and tables, and exploring data for visualization purposes.

Covid 19 data has been used for this project, and will be followed by Tableau and Power BI projects to visualize the data.

Thanks to Alex the analyst for the help alog the way.
